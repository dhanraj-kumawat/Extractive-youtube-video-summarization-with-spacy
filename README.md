YouTube transcripts are a valuable source of information that can be used for a variety of purposes,
such as research, education, and entertainment. Extractive text summarization is a technique that can
be used to create summaries of YouTube transcripts. 

Text Summarization:
Text summarization is the process of creating a short and concise version of a text while preserving the most important information.
There are two main types of text summarization: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization selects sentences from the original 
text that are relevant to the topic and combines them to create a summary. Abstractive summarization, on the other hand,
creates a summary by paraphrasing the original text and using its own words.
Here is an example of an extractive summary:
Original text: The company announced that it would be laying off 10% of its workforce. The layoffs were due to a decline in sales.
Extractive summary: The company laid off 10% of its workforce due to declining sales.
Here is an example of an abstractive summary:
Original text: The company announced that it would be laying off 10% of its workforce.
The layoffs were due to a decline in sales. The company had been struggling financially for several months, and the layoffs were seen as a
last-ditch effort to save the company.
